** TODO A Brief Discussion On "Model of Computation" :model_of_computation:

=Model of computation= concerns 2 properties: power and expressiveness. Turing machine has great power, but limited level of expressiveness. Other models of =model of computation= are =actor model=, =pi calculus=, =communicating sequential process=. [fn:1]

=Model of computation= is categorized into interactive/non-interactive computation [fn:2]. It is well known that =interactive model= is more powerful than non-interactive ones.
