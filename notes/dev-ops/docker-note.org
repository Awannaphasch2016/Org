Build Dockerfile

Note: I am sure how to add dockerfile as new =lang= to org-babel. (is this even the right approach?) check the following references.
- [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61247999/literate-programming-setup-of-docker-programming-environment-with-org-mode-in-em][Literate programming setup of Docker programming environment with org-mode in Emacs]]
- [[https://github.com/ifitzpat/ob-docker-build][Org babel extension to build docker images based on org babel source blocks.]]

Note: I am not sure if =dockerfile= tags do anything.

* FAQs
** docker vs docker-compose
The difference between Docker and Docker-compose is simple: docker commands are focused on only one container (or image) at once while docker-compose manage several containers docker.
