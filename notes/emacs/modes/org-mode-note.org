** How to set local variable for a specific mode? :latex:config:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: How to set local variable for a specific mode?
:END:

This type of tutorial/question is best to present with an example.
Given that I want to set =compile-command= variable for LaTex mode which applies to all buffer of this mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun set-compile-command-default-in-LaTeX-mode ()
  (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command) ;; create local variable specific to a current buffer
       (format "" (buffer-file-name))))

(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
          'set-compile-command-default-in-LaTeX-mode)

** how to set recurring todo tasks with org mode in emacs?
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: how to set recurring todo tasks with org mode in emacs?
:END:
First thing is to understand that behavior of a header block in org mode is dictated by properties.

I want to set repeating task to have the following functions
- when I change from TODO state to DONE state, a header block will log "state changes" with time stamp.

That is all the requirement I need for recurring tasks.

This can be done by setting the following
- set =:REPEAT_TO_STATE:= property under the header with =org-set-property=
- set either =DEADLINE= (=org-deadline=) or =SCHEDULE= (=org-schedule=) with recurring syntax [fn:1] , for example, adding =.+1d/+3d= to timestamp represent recurring every 1 day or 3 day. (it will be randomly assigned by org mode.).

first you must set header as followed
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO work on quiz 3
DEADLINE: <2022-03-03 Thu  .+1w>
:PROPERTIES:
:REPEAT_TO_STATE: TODO
:LAST_REPEAT: [2022-03-02 Wed 16:26]
:END:
#+END_SRC

Then when you change from TODO to DONE state, header will log "state change" in a =:LOGBOOK:= property, and DONE state will automatically change to TODO. (so you will not see DONE state appears.). Deadline is then reset to the next date and time.
#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* TODO work on quiz 3
DEADLINE: <2022-03-03 Thu .+1w>
:PROPERTIES:
:REPEAT_TO_STATE: TODO
:LAST_REPEAT: [2022-03-02 Wed 16:26]
:END:
:LOGBOOK:
- State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2022-03-02 Wed 16:26]
:END:

*** Show timer workflow by using example
**** insert list of times
if you prefer video explaining, see [[https://youtu.be/lxkPeJS6keY?t=285][here]]

0:00:05 first you must insert timer into buffer with =org-timer=.
- 0:02:35 :: once you have list with timer-prefix, creating new item with C-Entr will insert the next timestamp.
- 0:07:10 :: like this.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
With the basics in place, the rest of this tutorial describes the source block controls done by parameter settings. I’ve separated and organized these based on its usage:

Evaluation Parameters
like dir, affects how a block is executed

Export Parameters
affects how a block or the results from execution is shown when it is exported to HTML

Literate Programming Parameters
connecting blocks together to change the actual source code

Variable Parameters
variables for a source block can be set in various ways

Miscellaneous Input/Output
of course, you have to have a collection of parameters that don’t fit elsewhere
