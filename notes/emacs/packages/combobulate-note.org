Lets inspect ~combobulate-navigate-previous~ by step into the function.

The following functions are called in order:
1. ~combobulate-navigate-previous~
2. ~combobulate--move-point-to-node~
   responsible for display and move node.
3. ~(combobulate--navigate 'previous)~
   pass =previuos= to ~combobulate--navigate~
4. ~combobulate--nav-get-prev-sibling~
   get sibling node by query its parents node and get all of its nodes.
   sibling nodes are arrange in order, so getting previous or next siblings nodes is easy.
5. ~combobulate--nav-get-sibling-nodes~
   outputs list of nodes
6. ~seq filter~
   check for matched node.

Note that getting a node is done by using tree-sitter query. Tree-sitter API provides such query functions.


That's it.

Peace.
