=M-x erc-tls= is prefered   over =M-x erc= because when the server supports SSL/TLS, it will ensure that you make a secure connection to the server!

type =/join #somechannel= to join the channel
type =/part= to leave the channel. (you can kill the buffer afterward)
type =/list= to list all the channels.
type =/whois <user>= to get information about the =<user>=
type =/query <user>= to chat with =<user>= or the bots. (e.g. =/query NickServ=)

type =/nick <new-nick-name>= to rename your nickname

other basic commands
=/quit=
=/reconnect=

to register account to the server, see [[*To register account on the server][To register account on the server]].

* To register account on the server
type =/query NickServ= will open chat to bot that llows the owner of the nickname to disconnect a user from the network that is using their nickname.
