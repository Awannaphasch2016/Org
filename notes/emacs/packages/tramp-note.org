#+TITLE: Tramp Note

TRAMP mode is also known as RPC mode.

TRAMP (Transparent Remote Access, Multiple Protocols) is a package for editing remote files [...] Whereas the others use FTP to connect to the remote host and to transfer the files, TRAMP uses a remote shell connection (rlogin, telnet, ssh).

*** tramp is buggy and freeze alot.
as of <2021-11-18 Thu>, as the header says, tramp is very buggy and freeze alot.
This level of glitch is unusable. (for now)

I have observed the following behavior
Note: both =doom run= and =emacsclient= make no different.

freeze behavior can be described as followed
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When emacs freeze and it keep sending two-factor authentication to duo app every 10-20 secs also. (I tried this with fau koko clsuter which use two-factor authentication.)
#+END_QUOTE
freeze behavior is triggered by the following actions.
- Freeze when I open shell on the remote server using =M-x shell=.
- sometimes, I just can't save file. I can edit, but when save. Emacs freezes.
- sometimes, I can't even open remote file via ssh (usually happens after the first bugs is observed. This trigger dissapear when I close and reopen doom.)

* Basic Usage
** How to access remote files ?

a remote file name always look like =/method:user@host:/path/to/file= using the same =M-x find-file=.
example to login to fau KOKO server is to use =/ssh:awannaphasch2016@koko-login.hpc.fau.edu:/=

It also support =sudo=, see [[https://youtu.be/4pHid-kTBHw?t=409][here]] or [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=895][here]] or [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2177687/open-file-via-ssh-and-sudo-with-emacs/16408592][here]].
Error: all the sudo synxtax I tried below cause emacs to hangs. (hangs because wrong syntax or hangs because of bugs?)
- =/ssh:you@remotehost|sudo:remotehost:/path/to/file=
  you = awannaphasch2016
  remotehost = koko-login.hpc.fau.edu
  e.g.
  =/ssh:awannaphasch2016@koko-login.hpc.fau.edu|sudo:koko-login.hpc.fau.edu:/=
  =/ssh:awannaphasch2016@koko-login.hpc.fau.edu|sudo::/=
