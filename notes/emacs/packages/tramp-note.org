#+TITLE: Tramp Note

TRAMP mode is also known as RPC mode.

TRAMP (Transparent Remote Access, Multiple Protocols) is a package for editing remote files [...] Whereas the others use FTP to connect to the remote host and to transfer the files, TRAMP uses a remote shell connection (rlogin, telnet, ssh).
