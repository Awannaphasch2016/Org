I found myself asking myself this question to start writing my understand about it here. Still, I can't really figure what it really refers to. I presented my best attempt to understand it below.

=org-protocol= interacts with a browser in the following way.
1. highlight a content from web browser
2. click on web browser =booklet= (bookmark button)
3. with your =org-protocol= configuration can trigger emacs to perform something.
   For example, with the help org =org-protocol=,  the event after step 2. may be to open =org-capture= in emacs with =org-capture= template which contains information about location of the highlight.
4. In org capture, you can choose to make note on the highlight.
5. Save to appropriate location.
