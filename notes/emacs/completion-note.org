** A Note of X where X is Emacs's completion framework.

Ivy is a minibuffer completion package.

Swiper is defined as "Ivy-enhanced alternative to Isearch." Swiper uses ivy as a backend.

Counsel is defined as "a colletion of Ivy-enhanced versions of common Emacs commands". Counsel supplements completion functionality that ivy provides by replacing Emacs command with Counsel equivalent commands. The goal of command substitution is to provide a customised commands that make the best use of ivy.

* Choosing between =ivy-bibtex=, =helm-bibtex=, and =citar=.

I never use =ivy-bibtex=.
Comparing between =helm-bibtex= and =citar=, I really don't see any major  the difference.
So using either =helm-bibtex= or =citar= both works for me.
