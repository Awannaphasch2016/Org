* Useful Features
- Connect to multiple servers at once

- Channel tracking to show channel acticity in the mode line
- Show emojis in message
- Desktop notifications when mentinoed or messgaed (enabled as a module)
- Easy to script it with new behavior!
* Joining a server
=M-x erc-tls= to connect to a particle IRC server address and you'll be prompted for your "nickname." (the name you will use on the server) and your password.

=M-x erc-tls= is prefered over =M-x erc= because when the server supports SSL/TLS, it will ensure that you make a secure connection to the server!
