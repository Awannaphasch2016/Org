* String

** String literal

string literal are immutable.
** String type
string type manages data allocated on the heap.j

* Ownership
memory in Rust is managed through ownership with a set of rules that the compiler check at compile time.

- each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
