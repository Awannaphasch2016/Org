#+TITLE:  quotes

* In FP we don't tell the compute how to do things, we tell them what we want.
* Learn to rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist
* If you want to be lazy, make sure that lazy path is the correct one. * Object-oritned progrmaing makes code understanable by encapsulting moving pars. Functional programing makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts.
* programming quotes
** “Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence" by Edsger Dijkstra
** functional programing quotes
*** “Functional code is characterised by one thing: the absence of side effects.”
*** The best FP code is like algebra, and in algebra you never reuse variables. And not re-using variables has many benefit
** “To understand recursion, one must first understand recursion.” - Stephen Hawking.
