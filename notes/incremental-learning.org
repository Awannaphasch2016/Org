#+TITLE: Incremental Learning

toss coin to choose topics to learning

Just run the block below when I don't have any strong preference on which of these to learn.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Understanding triggers of your hesitation are keys to understand collections of preferences, called self.
#+END_QUOTE
Basically, if I hestitate to do what the coin tells you, just redo it.

Toss the coin by running the code below
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
topics = ["Emacs", "Blockchain", "Algorithm", "Prompt Programming", "Deep Learning and Data Science"]
import random

# return random.choice(topics)
print(random.choice(topics))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Emacs
