#+TITLE: Incremental Learning

toss coin to choose topics to learning

Just run the block below when I don't have any strong preference on which of these to learn.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Understanding triggers of your hesitation are keys to understand collections of preferences, called self.
#+END_QUOTE
Basically, if I hestitate to do what the coin tells you, just redo it.

Toss the coin by running the code below
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
topics = ["Emacs", "Blockchain", "Algorithm", "Prompt Programming", "Deep Learning and Data Science"]
import random

# return random.choice(topics)
print(random.choice(topics))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Emacs

currently, I implement the code in =~/Scratches/tmp1.py=
implementing demo todo
- find key of data that will be used to stored as data.
- store data in comma separated files. (other value like freq count can be derived from this one.)
- follow stream of 1 crypto news account. (This required me to only filter data that have screen_name key == account_name)
- try to run it overnight to collect data.
- check how data is structure.
  - in which scenario does `stream.filter(follow=[get_user_id("DocumentingBTC")], threaded=False)` returns any value at all.

** project: create website for blog using org mode.
*** goal: publish website that capable of hosting org file
- ref
  - read the following tutorial: https://thackl.github.io/blogging-with-emacs-org-mode-and-jekyll
- note
  - my current blog is using jekyll but files are .md not .org.
  - I started to add org files into my blogs directory without testing whether or not it will work. On top of that, I didn't even follow naming convention which, if I remember correct, are necessary to make jekyll works. Hence, I don't expect it to work, so debug it.
