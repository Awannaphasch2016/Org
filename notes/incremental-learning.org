#+TITLE: Incremental Learning

toss coin to choose topics to learning

Just run the block below when I don't have any strong preference on which of these to learn.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Understanding triggers of your hesitation are keys to understand collections of preferences, called self.
#+END_QUOTE
Basically, if I hestitate to do what the coin tells you, just redo it.

Toss the coin by running the code below
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
topics = ["Emacs", "Blockchain", "Algorithm", "Prompt Programming", "Deep Learning and Data Science"]
import random

# return random.choice(topics)
print(random.choice(topics))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: Emacs

** Emacs
*** TODO learn to implement in emacs using elisp

- Figure out how to properly use variation of =interaction= keyword in lisp function.
*** Contribute to EAF
- look at [[https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework/wiki/Todo-List][EAF TODO list]] and pick one
*** Understand Emacs at the deeper level
**** learn about the following packages and workflow

******* implement =open in other window= behavior such that you can open bookmark, recent files, buffer etc to other buffer using =shift + enter=
******* create custom keybinding for scroll up and down other window. (make sure that it is intuitive and can be generalized to be combine with other key binding. )
******* implement =toggling= behavior for switching between previously visited window and next (current) window. (This is useful when using with =ace-window=)
******* create popup window in emacs (like what I use in vim)
****** move section of code to scratch file, see [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/2810/how-to-copy-or-move-code-in-current-scope-to-end-of-another-file][here]] for reference.

Error:
=flycheck-list-error=  and =lsp-treemacs-list-error= are not insync.
=flycheck-list-error= shows =unable to import 'pandas' [import-error]=

For =mspyls=, =lsp-treemacs-error-list= only shows error from =tgn= project.
=mspyls= and =pyls=
