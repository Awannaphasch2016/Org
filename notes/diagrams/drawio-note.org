draw.io has two types of connectors: fixed and floating. fixed connector connect arrow to a fixed point on the shape. On the other hand, floating connectors ignore fixed point on the shape and connect to position in the frame which can be any position on the edge of the shape.

To create fixed connector, draw arrow from source shape to one of the fixed point on edges of destination shape. To create floating connector, draw arrow from source shape to none-fixed point on edges of destination shape.
