[fn:1] At https://youtu.be/EZrHzyqIYIQ?t=3531, Alan Kay mentioned Dave Reed's PhD dissertation titled "Design of Operating system for the internet" in 1978. I can't find paper with the same title of the same year, but I can find Dissertation of Dave Reed from MIT in 1978 with different title. I am not sure if it is the same thing.
