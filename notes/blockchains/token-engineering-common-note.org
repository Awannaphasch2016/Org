This content most fit here. If I understand the structure correctly.

I just wanna share a very rough categorization of working group's responsibility.
 I think it is important to understand the overview of DAO components based on existing provided services.
You can use this to think about what TCE currently has, what TCE will need, what can we outsource.

Phases:
- Near-real time, complete treasury picture (with working group multisigs)
- Near-real time, complete working group budget and spending picture
- No actual cash flow projections --
	- No revenues (yet!)
	- Too difficult to predict spending because of conviction voting
	- Can maybe do working group spending projections
	- Griff offered to pull together some projection here!
