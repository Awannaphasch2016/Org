** TODO Understand stablecoin
Goal of stablecoins are to make cryptocurrency more stable. As of [2022-05-01 Sun], from what I understand, stablecoins peg fiat currency and try to make sure that ratio of stablecoins:fiat is 1:1, see tether price, which is a stablecoin, in figure ref:tether_price.

Stablecoin can be used by trader and crypto. In the first usecase, stablecoins are pegged by crypto currency to reduce price's volatility. As of [2022-05-01 Sun], from what I understand, for this reason, when crypto volatility increase, volatility will be propagated to fiat currency that stablecoins peg. This stablecoin is adopted with a hypothesis that when volatility of crypto currency propagate to fiat currency, regulation will stablized the volatility in fiat currency which will propagate back to crypto currency resulting in more stable behavior due to regulation.

It can be used as a "hold out" methods. When traders cash out on a crypto trade, there is a high fees to cash out by converting crypto to fiat. To reduce the fee, instead of cashing out crypto trade to fiat, one can cash out the trade to stablecoin.

Stablecoin carries an inherent risk. Stablecoins are backed by companies with a promised to have invested fiat back by other fiats or assets. However, there is no way to be sure that companies do as it promised. Report could be manipulated.

** TODO Understanding: Staking Mechanism in blockchain
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Staking token earns token holder cash flow as passive income without selling token. It is equivalent of a high-yield saving account. As of <2022-04-23 Sat>, the return are much higher than interest rate offers by banks

Staking token is a "lockup" mechanism which as the name suggests token is lock away during a fixed time interval which mean token cannot be sold. The longer one stake their token can be interpreted as confident one's have in the project.

In practice, staking is usually done via staking pool. the goal is to lower the barrier of entry of users. Validators acts as delegators (people who act on behalf of others) to run a staking pool and raise funds from a group of token holders. This is equivalent of saying "Given the current cost, stakers will pay validator to solve puzzle and every gained rewards will be sent to stakers." To justify actions with risk and reward, risk that stakers takes is (future rewards - future cost) will be more than (the current reward - the current cost) while validator takes on the opposite side of the trade.

Type of coin staking.

*** TODO token bonding curve (TBC)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4d9b3c1e-e782-4bff-b2a1-7992cc1c99b9
:END:
Bonding curve is a function of relationship between price and supply. In tokenomics, bonding curve is called token bonding curve (TBC). It needs a new name because bonding curve function, in addition to supply and supply,  minting/burning mechanisms are used to increase/decrease supply of tokens, respectively. TBC function is implemented in smart contract.

TBC is a primitive price discovery mechanism. Price discovery is defined as followed [fn:4]
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The price discovery process is the process of determining the price of an asset in the marketplace through the interactions of buyers and sellers.
#+END_QUOTE


When you "buy up" a bonding curve means you mint new tokens. As a result, token supply increases and cause price to increase. The process is vice versa when you "sell down" a bonding curve.

According to [fn:2], TBC enable users to buy tokens outside of exchange. As of [2022-05-03 Tue] I don't understand why it enable this. As of [2022-05-03 Tue], I don't understand how TBC can be used for. Common use case for bonding cure are ICO (funding).

[supply token vs reserve token?]

Properties of TBC are as followed: [fn:4]
1. TBC is a function of token's price and supply, see figure ref:example_of_TBC for illustration.
2. monotonic function (always increasing)
3. deterministic

Parameters for TBC design are time, pricing, collateral, issuance, supply, function, and composition [fn:4].
