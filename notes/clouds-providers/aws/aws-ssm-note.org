** pros and cons
*** pros

If you are in AWS then some features to like about the SSM approach over traditional SSH are:[fn:1]

- No direct network path required. There is no need to punch holes in your VPC layers and chain bastions.
- Instance authentication controlled through IAM and by extension whichever IdP you may be federating human access with.
- Initial access and every userspace command audited and logged. To create break-glass alerts or “taint” instances that have been accessed is a breeze.
