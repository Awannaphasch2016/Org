#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whenever I have something that works (meaning, doesn't break anything for anyone else) I'll do a check-in. I write most of my stuff test first, so that means every time I have a new test that passes, I check-in.

In practice that means a few times per hour. At least a couple of times every hour, with 5 being quite a bit.

One of principle I follow is

#+name: qoute
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
never rely on others' people goodwill.
and
always expect other to be evil when it is possible.
#+END_QUOTE

In quote ref:qoute, type of =evil= falls into incompetent evil and irresponsible evil. Putting this principle into practice, one must understand structures that govern behavior of people given a particular pursuit of goal.

In this scenario, I refers =structure= as =git log=  and =a particular pursuite of goal= as =learning and understanding a piece of code such as open source code.=

A common practice to understand open source is to "read readme.md", "read documentation", or "look at examples." All of these violate the principle since it expects other to have readme, documentation, and examples or you to look at.

What is the alternative? you asked. One alternative would be to look at git history and go back into git commit history and inspect the bare minimum that make the very thing you want to learn work at all. This approach remove boiler plate of dependencies that make the feature you wanted to learn work with other components (which, often than not, you don't care about it).

Before you commit to learn from a particular piece of code, you have to skim through. Given that you found the code on github, the quickest way is to go to =users/git-repo/commits/branch?before=most-recent-comment+total-number-of-commits=. For example, on [2022-06-15 Wed] at 6.35 PM GMT-4 =torvalds/linux= repo on github as =1105072= commits  =https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commits/master?before=afe9eb14ea1cbac5d91ca04eb64810d2d9fa22b0+1105072= shows commit page where the most bottom commit is the first commit of Linux ever committed using git version control.

When using =before= argument (alternatively, you can use =after= argument), commit timeline can be visualized as followed.

#+name: git-commit-timeline
#+BEGIN_SRC org
                 [--------github-commit-page-------]
(-inf)-(-2)-(-1)-(target-commit)-(+1)-(+2)-...-(+35)-...-(+inf)
#+END_SRC

where left commit is older and =github commit page= can contain at most 35 commits.
Note: math to show commits on =commit page= may be abit off, but you get the idea.

** Automate Github workflow using github (gh) command line.
use github command for the following things
| commands                       | descriptions                   |
| gh repo create <new-repo-name> | create new repo on your github |
| gh repo list                   | list all of my github repo     |

I am sure that Delete repo
command of gh needs scope to operate. (e.g.  delete_repo scope)
Therefore, you need the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s delete_repo
#+END_SRC

This will raise Authenticate Git with your Github credentials? to make sure that real you wanted to expand on the scope.

what scope you ask? It is a OAuth Scope. More precisely, personal token scope that you need to set to use github API. ref:token-scope.

That's it.
Peace.
** A Note on X where X = Git Forge
A forge is a web-based collaborative software platform for developing and distributing computer application. Example include Github and Gitlab.

** Credential caching
ref:
Stack overflow: [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6565357/git-push-requires-username-and-password][Permanently authenticating git repos]]
Github Doc: [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git#platform-linux][Caching your GitHub credentials in Git]]

From =git config --help=
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Credential.helper
    Specify an external helper to be called when a username or password credential is needed; the helper
    may consult external storage to avoid prompting the user for the credentials. Note that multiple
    helpers may be defined. See gitcredentials(7) for details.
#+END_QUOTE

To cache git credentials, you must use GCM core by set up =credential.help=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git config credential.helper store
#+END_SRC

To specify caching expire.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout 7200'
#+END_SRC

Once, you set up GCM core and type in credential for the first time.
Crentials will be cached, and you no longer need to type it for the second time and beyond.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git push https://github.com/owner/repo.git
#+END_SRC

** [[https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core][Git Credential Manager Core]] (GCM Core)
To read about, GCM core status and support, see [[https://github.com/microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-Core#current-status][here]].
To read about how to use GCM, see [[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/caching-your-github-credentials-in-git#git-credential-manager-core][here]].

Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the Windows credential manager and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.

** Switching git permission
To read more about gitcredentials from git documentation, see [[https://git-scm.com/docs/gitcredentials][here]].

Note: I haven't read it. just skimmed through, and failed.

Permission information can be found at =~/.gitconfig~=

To change, credentials (Often, you need this option when you need different set of permissions.),
see [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20195304/how-do-i-update-the-password-for-git][here]].

Error: I couldn't do it sucessfully.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
#+END_SRC
After, a username and password prompt will appear with your next Git action (pull, clone, push, etc.).
