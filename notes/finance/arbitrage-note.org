Frontrunner is a block that get information from block that received recent transaction. Frontrunner runs transaction address locally to check if a executing MEV strategy will result in profits. Profits is gained from taking winning reward (MEV) from winning block. In practice, frontrunner block imitates a winning block by simply replacing an address of the winning block with its own. Frontrunner increase market efficiency by speed up information propagation across block chain network.

A significant portion of MEV transactions is routed through Flashbots, meaning generalized frontrunners aren't as effective as they used to be.

*** gas golfing
gas golfing is a techniques to reduce gas usage to execute MEV strategy.

A few well-known gas golf techniques include: using addresses that start with a long string of zeroes (e.g. 0x0000000000C521824EaFf97Eac7B73B084ef9306) since they take less space (and hence gas) to store; and leaving small ERC-20 token balances in contracts, since it costs more gas to initialize a storage slot (the case if the balance is 0) than to update a storage slot. Finding more techniques to reduce gas usage is an active area of research among searchers.
