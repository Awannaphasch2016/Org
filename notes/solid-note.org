*** the solid ecosystem enables people to pick the apps they need, while storing their data wherever they want
*** The solid design
**** the solid server acts as a data pod that stores and guards your data.
***** a regular web server
***** application-agnostic
***** just like your website
your data can be opened with any app.
**** a typical data pod can contain any data you create or need online.
such as profile, photos, comments, likes
