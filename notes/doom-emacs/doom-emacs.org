#+TITLE: Notes

* Installation

Note:
version of emacs in Ubuntu is lower than version of emacs required by Doom emacs, so you must install the required version following this [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#install][guide]]. (Basically, you must new apt-repo with =add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs=)

If =$EMACS= environment variable is not set or incorrectly set, you will get =Can't find emacs in your PATH= error.

* Help section and related info
To open doom emacs documentation, use =doom/help.= which is binded to =spc-h-d-h=
* Notes for Developers
** Directory and Files Organization (How is doom-emacs connected to emacs?)
From my inspection, I believe that Doom Module enable in =init.el= are located in =~/.emacs.d/modules/tools= which contains ~README~ and configuration code. (the actual code from downloaded packages are still in =~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repo=)
** debug with sandbox, see [[https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/testing-elisp-packages-in-dooms-sandbox/74][here]].
