** TODO Using terminal in Emacs.
The goal is to cover all the basic usecases one would need to start using terminal effortlessly within emacs.

To open multiple terminal, a neat trick is to rename file buffer that terminal is opened [fn:1].

To open file from terminal, one can just =M-x find-file= in the terminal buffer. This is because terminal buffer is just another terminal.


* Doom behavior that could cause error
** skipping recompiling/reloading packing (by using cache), see example of the error here ([[*how to fix error that is caused by running the whole =init.el=.]]).
* Errors
** Errors and Debugging log (logs of how I debug it).
* Installation

Note:
version of emacs in Ubuntu is lower than version of emacs required by Doom emacs, so you must install the required version following this [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#install][guide]]. (Basically, you must new apt-repo with =add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs=)

If =$EMACS= environment variable is not set or incorrectly set, you will get =Can't find emacs in your PATH= error.

* Notes for Developers
** Directory and Files Organization (How is doom-emacs connected to emacs?)
From my inspection, I believe that Doom Module enable in =init.el= are located in =~/.emacs.d/modules/tools= which contains ~README~ and configuration code. (the actual code from downloaded packages are still in =~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repo=)
** debug with sandbox, see [[https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/testing-elisp-packages-in-dooms-sandbox/74][here]].

Example of the error extracted from =~/.emacs.d/.local/doom.error.log=
#+BEGIN_SRC md
(invalid-read-syntax ")")

(read #<buffer  *load*-815022>)

(eval-buffer #<buffer  *load*-815022> nil "/home/awannaphasch2016/.emacs.d/.local/elpa/dap-mode-20211003.934/dap-mode-autoloads.el" nil t)

... (more error)
#+END_SRC

From inspecting =eval-buffer= and noticing =(invalid-read-syntax ")")=, I solve the problem by looking in to ="/home/awannaphasch2016/.emacs.d/.local/elpa/dap-mode-20211003.934/dap-mode-autoloads.el"= and found that there indeed mismatch of parenthesis. (using =check-parens=)
Furthermore, the top of =dap-mode-autoloads.el= mentioned that the file is automatically loaded, acknowledge this fact, I suspect that content has been unintentionally edit.

Note: I could have confirmed by doing =git stash=, but it turns out that elpa doesn't use git to clone (This is why =straight.el= was proposed in the first place, see [[file:~/org/notes/emacs/package-manager/straight.org::*Features][here]])

From abit more digging, I realised that doom emacs have the behavior of reloading/recompiling packages to reduce initialization time, but this cause loading and initialization errors.
