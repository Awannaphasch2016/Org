To open multiple terminal, a neat trick is to rename file buffer that terminal is opened [fn:1].

To open file from terminal, one can just =M-x find-file= in the terminal buffer.

** Keybinding In Doom Emacs :doom:keybinding:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: Keybinding In Doom Emacs
:ID:       66ee45f0-ffe9-40d0-b33d-50b96fb98b50
:END:

Doom Emacs has its own keybinding system. A more accurate explaination is
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Doom Emacs keybinding system is a wrapper over evil mode such that it is smoothly compatible with Emacs.
#+END_QUOTE

If you use Evil mode without Emacs configuration framework such as Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, it is frustrating to  know if your keybinding is setup properly and whether it will always work as expected in any circumstances. A common point of failure is when your keybinding is overwritten by some packages. Most of the time, creators of those packages don't use evil-mode, so their implementations don't respect evil-mode, rightfully so.

This is annoying because there is no peace of mind. You can't assume that it will always works in all cases. It always a process of "lets try it here, there, what about that, ...". Because of this, if I don't need the binding that BADLY, I don't even try it.

Another annoying point is it is one of those problem that you think it should be fixed long along. Also, its one of those that is not that hard to try to solve, but it isn't interesting enough. On top of that, you also have to expect iterative process of re-implementing things whenever edge cases came up. tedious process of boringness. And because it is solvable, you can't even blame others, but yourself.

Thanks God. Dooms Emacs solves this problem for us. I am not sure how much Doom Emacs fixed this problem. To my knowledge, I have no problem YET using Doom Emacs keybinding configuration system.

Assuming that you use evil-mode and use ~map!~ to modify your key [fn:4], you have to answer the following question.
1. What is the keymap you will use? (=:map=)
2. Do you expect to use your keymap in "evil state" or "emacs state"?
3. Is there any condition you want to be true to enable the key? (=:when=)
4. Which prefix option do you choose, if any? is it =:leader=, =:localleader=, or =:prefix= (your customize prefix).
5. What is the mode you want to enable your keymap? (=:after=)

As an example, I have =org-cdlatex-mode= enable when I open org mode file and =`= (uptick key) is map to ~cdlatex-math-symbol~ command when I am in =evil-insert-state=. I eval the following expression to assign =`= to nil to allow me to type =`= in =evil-insert-state=.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noeval
(map! :after org-cdlatex-mode
  (:map org-cdlatex-mode-map
    "`" nil))
#+END_SRC

Without =map!=, you will have to write hook to run after =org-cdlatex-mode= is enable as followed.
#+name: rebind_uptick_in_org_cdlatex_mode_map
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noeval
(defun org-cdlatex-mode-map-hook ()
  (define-key org-cdlatex-mode-map (kbd "`") nil))
(eval-after-load 'org-cdltex-mode
  (add-hook ''org-cdllatex-mode-hook 'org-cdlatex-mode-map-hook))
#+END_SRC
As of [2022-07-11 Mon], I am not sure what is the difference usage between ~with-eval-after-load~ vs ~eval-after-load~.

That's it.
Peace.

** X Implementation Where X = Doom Emacs's +lookup/ Command. :lookup:doom:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: X Implementation Where X = Doom Emacs's +lookup Command
:ID:       c40d1650-ec6d-44df-83aa-3ce6f424159e
:END:

I was trying to figure out ~+lookup/definition~ that open in other window. In one of the issue, Henrik [fn:2] mention that some =lookup= backend (As an example, =xref= is a built in backend for lookup) are asynchronous and there is no standardized mechanism to talk to them to see whether the command runs successfully [fn:3].

lets call this new command ~+lookup/definition-other-window~
Current possible solutions are
1. ignore validation step to make sure that the command runs succesfully.
2. when the command is called, switch to other window then run ~+lookup/definition~ command.
   It can be implemented as followed
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(dolist (fn '(definition references))
  (fset (intern (format "+lookup/%s-other-window" fn))
        (lambda (identifier &optional arg)
          "TODO"
          (interactive (list (doom-thing-at-point-or-region)
                             current-prefix-arg))
          (let ((pt (point)))
            (switch-to-buffer-other-window (current-buffer))
            (goto-char pt)
            (funcall (intern (format "+lookup/%s" fn)) identifier arg)))))
   #+END_SRC

I just thinks its interesting, so I figure I write something about it.

That's it.
Peace.

* Installation

Note:
version of emacs in Ubuntu is lower than version of emacs required by Doom emacs, so you must install the required version following this [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/docs/getting_started.org#install][guide]]. (Basically, you must new apt-repo with =add-apt-repository ppa:kelleyk/emacs=)

If =$EMACS= environment variable is not set or incorrectly set, you will get =Can't find emacs in your PATH= error.

From inspecting =eval-buffer= and noticing =(invalid-read-syntax ")")=, I solve the problem by looking in to ="/home/awannaphasch2016/.emacs.d/.local/elpa/dap-mode-20211003.934/dap-mode-autoloads.el"= and found that there indeed mismatch of parenthesis. (using =check-parens=)
Furthermore, the top of =dap-mode-autoloads.el= mentioned that the file is automatically loaded, acknowledge this fact, I suspect that content has been unintentionally edit.

Note: I could have confirmed by doing =git stash=, but it turns out that elpa doesn't use git to clone (This is why =straight.el= was proposed in the first place, see [[file:~/org/notes/emacs/package-manager/straight.org::*Features][here]])

From abit more digging, I realised that doom emacs have the behavior of reloading/recompiling packages to reduce initialization time, but this cause loading and initialization errors.
