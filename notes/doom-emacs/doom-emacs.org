#+TITLE: Notes

To open doom emacs documentation, use =doom/help.= which is binded to =spc-h-d-h=

* Directory and Files Organization (How is doom-emacs connected to emacs?)
From my inspection, I believe that Doom Module enable in =init.el= are located in =~/.emacs.d/modules/tools= which contains ~README~ and configuration code. (the actual code from downloaded packages are still in =~/.emacs.d/.local/straight/repo=)
