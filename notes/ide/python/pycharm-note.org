Note: still not sure what the cause of the problem is.

Answer that work from jetbrain discussion is provided below.
first solution
1) Please uncheck "Run with Python console" in your Run/Debug Configuration and try again.

2) Try as described here https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-28457#focus=streamItem-27-2706036-0-0

Note: Once you tried first solution, note that sometimes, root directory is still not set to PYTHONPATH, so you have to add PYTHONPATH in manually in the debug/run edit option under "Environment Variables."
Note: Also test both run and debug, because sometimes, run works and other times debug works. Error is still unknown, but this solutions works so far.
