#+TITLE: Prompt Programming Notes

* Characteristic of GPT-3 prediction dynamics?
1. GPT-3 distribution is a "superposition of authors."
2. GPT-3 is contrainted by its ability to predict sequence of tokens.
3. When prompt doesn't resemble the training data, GPT-3 behavior tends to be non-anthropomorphic, e.g. getting stuck in loops.
