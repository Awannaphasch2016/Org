** Enable x11 display in WSL2

I successfully connect x-apps via x11 protocol by first installing and launching xming server. Xming application provides x11-server. Then, I need to tell the wsl2 "address and port of X11 server to connect wsl2 application to" (my note on x11 can be seen [[https://roamresearch.com/#/app/AdaptiveGraphStucture/page/f433e8apo][here]]) X11 server is enlisted as WSL2 entrusted DNS which located in resolve.conf. (my note on resolve.conf can be seen [[https://roamresearch.com/#/app/AdaptiveGraphStucture/page/I1FI0mnUx][here]].) From the image below, x11 server port is =0.0=.

In practice, I need to put the following in shell configuration file. In my case, it was =.zshrc=.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
export DISPLAY="`grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | sed 's/nameserver //'`:0"
#+END_SRC

My friend gets it working by replacing =:0= with =:0.0=. I couldn't tell you why, but that's something to be careful about.
** Getting emacs-everywhere to work with wsl2?

TOPIC: fail to send execute command from window terminal to send command to be executed in wsl2.
---------------------------
attempt:

default is Ubuntu 20.04.
I set variable in win32 using /p flag.
I just use the example from https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/share-environment-vars-between-wsl-and-windows/

--------------------------
goal:
my goal is I want to do the following:
set keybinding in window such that when I press the key, window terminal will send command to wsl2 (ubuntu) to execute emacs command to open emacs in existing X window. (port of the X window is set with $DISPLAY.)

I am not really sure how process get created and what environment variables that it inherets. Is it possible to somehow ask window terminal to use process that have wsl2 ubuntu environment variables?

my failed attempt above is to create a share environment variable between window and wsl2 which I don't think would have solve my goal because I just want to have a process that have environment variables of wsl2 to execute emacs command.

===========================
The exact emacs command I am trying to use is emacsclient -e "(emacs-everywhere)" which send to  command to emacs daemon to execute
Image
my attempt maybe completely off. I am not familiar with system programming, so any advice is appreciated.

============
sending command to wsl2 from powershell
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
wsl path -e sh -c "some commands"
#+END_SRC

it is impossible because by design window process is not encourage to communicate to wsl2 process. This is to prevent process conflict. Make sense.

wsl2 works with Linux system call and have faster speed compared to wsl.

According to picture ref:110279260, translation layer of Windows NT Kernel tracks system call of wsl2. Downside of wsl2 is there will always be delay to adapt wsl2 to broken update from Linux.

things that can break/be slow are translation of filesystems/memory model/permission models are different.

* Configuration
** open files from within wsl2 using window applicationa

<2021-11-07 Sun>
to open files from within wsl2 using window applications, I use symbolic link from ~/usr/bin/wslview~ to ~/usr/local/bin/xd-opens~ as followed:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :noeval
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/wslview /usr/local/bin/xd-opens
#+END_SRC
