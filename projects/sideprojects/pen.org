#+caption: Example process from a decentalized collaborative learning model. The figure is borrowed from [fn:1]. In the figure, from what I understand on [2022-04-27 Wed], token is paid to computation resources (e.g. GPU cluster) to train model with provided data, and the trained model is also charged token to perform prediction.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
Data ===send-to====> generalized model ====training-scheme======> Multiple speciliazed task.
#+END_SRC

Note that training-scheme can be contributed by either new training-scheme or optimization of the same training-scheme.

The goal for tokenomic design in this scenario is to align incentive to train models and use model. According to [fn:2], there are three steps to mechanism design.

1. choose a goal
2. choose a reward mechanism
3. choose a reward function to match it.

Goal is "to align incentive to train models and use model." The question to answer is the following

1. why would anyone pay to train model? token is paid to whom when one train model?

   One would want to pay to train model if model is a collective good that acts as a generalized model. The additional data that is provided by user is to train model to specialize in solving a specific task.


2. why would anyone pay to use model?

   One would want to pay to use model if model provide predictive tasks that satisfy one's need.

3. Token is paid to whom?

   Of course, token is paid to the model in pay-per-train scheme or pay-per-use scheme.

   - Users who provide either data or training-scheme will be rewarded with fee in token.
   - Users who train data will pay token fee to DAO, training-scheme provider, computation resource provider.
   - Users who use model will pay token fee to data provider, training-scheme provider, DAO, and computation resource provider.

:END:
just a friendly reminder, meeeting at 5 pm flodara today.
Due to my time constraint, we should keep the meeting around 1 hours, so the meeting needs to be very focused.

main topic of discussion will be
- fill out the form [[https://www.fau.edu/innovation-and-business-development/][FAU's Innovation and Business Development Pipeline]]
- setting up 2 office hours (each for you and I, so 4 hours in total). we can have things like "tutorial session," "chill with us." (aka coffee hours), will talk more in the meeting.
- roadmaps for developer and road maps for community
- discuss about what can be "killer features"
- tasks for whiter paper to complete
- design of DAO.

if both of us can prepare presentation (not a hard restriction because I just told you now, but later meeting, we should put priority on this.), it should make the meeting alot more professional and possibly can be upload to social platform without much editing.
