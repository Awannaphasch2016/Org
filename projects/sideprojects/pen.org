*** WAITING write out business plan required for me to execute pen.el start up plan. what does a founder need to know before starting a company? how to estimate value of the business? what is the time horizon (can I start doing it before starting the summer)? what do I need to know because deciding on the amount of money that pen.el need to continue the project? :WAITING:
