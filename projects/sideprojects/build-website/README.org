** TODO when running ~./build.sh~ I get the following error
#+TAGS: build-webiste

I encounter this error while following [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfkrzFodoNw][this tutorial]]
If it is too cumbersome to follow the method shown in the tutorial, consider trying ox-hugo which is shown in [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6S-AKm5snc][this tutorial]]

Resetting org-publish-cache
Publishing file /home/awannaphasch2016/org/projects/sideprojects/garun/garun.org using ‘org-html-publish-to-html’
Unable to resolve link: "id:477a742f-e420-4111-8107-3c7947ad8331"
#+END_SRC
