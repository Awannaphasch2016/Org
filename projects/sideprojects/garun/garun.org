***** create org-capture such that new added content will be appended to the end of the file.
***** implement tagging system in org roam
****** note
******* follow roam research's tagging system which use page,block,filter by page,backlink, reference link.
******** tags and categories features from org-mode can be derived by roam research tagging system
******* one thing that roam research tagging doesn't provide is when I set page as directory for example dir1/dir2/dir3. To improve roam research to include this features few things have to be considered
******** pages should be able to filter by directory.

***** integrate organice to push org files to clouds where I can be access via phone and enable syncing between device.

***** presentation
****** try using =demo-it= plugins for code along styles presentation
***** PROJECT implement a command such that when inside a subtree, I can close the parent subtree in which the cursor is wihtin.
***** org roam
****** when inside of a page, I should be able to select existing heading of the selected pages to insert as a link.
The user experience here is more seamless than having to navigate to the page -> find the heading -> copy link from the heading and come back to insert.

This faetures is waiting on implementation on [[*PROJECT multi-layer text search filter. (design UI experience for piping sequence of regex output)][PROJECT multi-layer text search filter. (design UI experience for piping sequence of regex output)]]
****** for any heading that have a link attach to it, id should be automatically generated so that that this block now will be treated as a "node" which have a set of faetures available to it.

example of feature that can be useful are "synchonized name change" (name of the reference node change when the original node name is change.)
***** PROJECT implement tagging system. currently, I used other people default setup and it doesn't fit my needs.
***** typing ']]' will close code block that doesn't yet been close. This is behavior is similar to latex in vim that I have set up. (This enhances flexibility of use case)

******* display all trees (similar to nerd tree strcuture) of actions, so one can switch to different subtree in the "actions tree" or switching to different "action tree."
******* easily move reselect new actions from existing of subtrees
***** I want string in the notes to be data in which one can highlight section to select the data then programming-langauge/filtering/functions/command can be applied to manipulate the dataset.

**** data science features
***** passing scripts from your favorite language, and have them all available in emacs as commands.
ref: http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp_perl_wrapper.html
***** allow org-babel code block to stop before finish running. (This is because sometime I want to run something at the begining of the code for debug. Without this funcationality I cannot document the code as efficiently.)
There are 2 ways to do this.
1. set time limit which code block will automatically execute
2. send command to cancle the run. (kill process)
**** PROJECT interacting with pdf files (seamless pdf interaction experience)
***** to use pdf-isearch-occur one first need to use isearch-occur -> type in a text -> run pdf-isearch-occur to find words in pdf. (or i need to run pdf-isearch-minor-mode, but it is slow and keybinding may need to remap to match evil-mode keybinding.)
***** very buggy and unpredicable at times
**** colloborative features
***** real time coding
****** using Floobits to share code editing in real time (this allow sharing real time independent of text editor or IDE being used.)
****** TODO learn to use Iedit for multi-occurrence editing in your buffer, see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrNOLTAl1ug&ab_channel=AritraBhattacharjee][here]].

**** Dealing with Images
***** improve on image-dired
****** display list of existing tags globally and locally
******* when select tags to display tagged images, ui should show window at the bottom and list of files + directory of each images and ui should allow for further filtering by matched word. (This ui idea is similar to ~+default/search-buffer~ )
This is a very interesting workflow that reduce fiction between a user's thought to output.

usecase:
imagine that when you think of "vacation." You can get all of the pictures that have vacation tags and you may filter it further by file name and dir name (e.g. "2020", "Thailand").
****** provide autocomplete mechanism when trying to mark by tags. (C-t f)
****** Allow image preview as seen in [[https://youtu.be/HzFqZ0Gl0aw?t=238][this video.]]
I believe that this behavior is done using image-dired.

list of candidate command that I think can create the desired behavior.
When inside of dired mode
~image-dired~next-line-and~display~
~image-dired~previous-line-and~display~
When inside image-dired mode (only whos thumbnail)
~image-dired-display-next-thumbnail~
~image-dired-display-previous-thumbnail~

The problem is when using these commands the following undesired behavior occurs
1. when run command, cursor position has move into newly opened buffer.
2. when run command, newly created buffer replace the original buffer.


Error:
displaying thumbnail default behavior in doom emacs are strange to use. Behavior is not as the same as the one shown in [[https://youtu.be/NrY3t3W0_cM?t=154][this video.]]

ref:

~Bookmarkplus~ allows one to bookmark things beyond just file. It contains interesting ideas and workflows, but this workflow may results in very unorganized bookmark which may overtime becomes unobtainable.
If I in the future finds default ~Bookmark~ functionality to be limited, ~Bookmarkplus~ should be further explored.

***** select files in dired by regex.

    literate programming using org-babel to tangle codes in non linear ways. This idea can be expanded to utilize leo ideo ideas of "outline nodes organization" (finer than file-based organization). To do this each org-babel block must be able to references "inside" other blocks (not only as input to other block) by tagging nodes of the block. t

Demo of this feature is demonstrated by using org-babel with org block and org-roam  literater devops + nodes-outlines organization (from leo IDE).
