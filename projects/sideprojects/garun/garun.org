#+TITLE: garun projects
#+STARTUP: inlineimages
#+FILETAGS: garun emacs PERSONAL @sideproject

This project is an effect to create my ideal PKM with emacs 2.0 (emacs + pen.el). Effect made toward pen.el project will be documented in [[file:~/org/projects/sideprojects/pen.org][pen.el project file]].

Goal: I envision Garun to support the following things
- GTD
- For programmer + boundless extensibilities.
- Note-Taking (hand writing + typing).
- Agenda + Schedule + Clocking.
- seamless collaboration with other people and other apps. (superior functionality of emacs like emacs search should be able to it over other apps.)
- Garun should also share the same features on multiple computers either remote or local.
- automatically generate structure data that you own.
- optimal keybinding. (vim + whichkey like )
- allow user to publish contents online.
- accessible via mobile, any OS, laptop, desktop.
- Complex functionality is nicely sealed for ease of use. (provide help options to incrementally learn about Garun, consist of layer to )
- protect against content loss.
- provide optimized workflow via 'workflow mode.'
- provide resembrance agents for each 'workflow mode'.
- optimize for one screen/multiple screen.
- compute scoring for task priority. (One can pick and choose tasks from the task priority list to create daily planning each day.)
  - this features is inspired by Amplenote. I just saw it here [fn:1]
- daily planning that one create should be sync to modern online calendar apps.
- provide notes/thought (seedling) to resurface itself automatically via space everything.
- garun should provide inference that automate manual step.
  - the inference must be low false negative, its okay to have high false positive as a trade off
  - example of this is
    - garun inferences a string that resemble directory and provide a function that would open directory from the inference string.

****** for any heading that have a link attach to it, id should be automatically generated so that that this block now will be treated as a "node" which have a set of faetures available to it.

example of feature that can be useful are "synchonized name change" (name of the reference node change when the original node name is change.)

**** Dealing with Images
***** improve on image-dired
****** display list of existing tags globally and locally
******* when select tags to display tagged images, ui should show window at the bottom and list of files + directory of each images and ui should allow for further filtering by matched word. (This ui idea is similar to ~+default/search-buffer~ )
This is a very interesting workflow that reduce fiction between a user's thought to output.

usecase:
imagine that when you think of "vacation." You can get all of the pictures that have vacation tags and you may filter it further by file name and dir name (e.g. "2020", "Thailand").
****** provide autocomplete mechanism when trying to mark by tags. (C-t f)
****** Allow image preview as seen in [[https://youtu.be/HzFqZ0Gl0aw?t=238][this video.]]
I believe that this behavior is done using image-dired.

list of candidate command that I think can create the desired behavior.
When inside of dired mode
~image-dired~next-line-and~display~
~image-dired~previous-line-and~display~
When inside image-dired mode (only whos thumbnail)
~image-dired-display-next-thumbnail~
~image-dired-display-previous-thumbnail~

The problem is when using these commands the following undesired behavior occurs
1. when run command, cursor position has move into newly opened buffer.
2. when run command, newly created buffer replace the original buffer.


Error:
displaying thumbnail default behavior in doom emacs are strange to use. Behavior is not as the same as the one shown in [[https://youtu.be/NrY3t3W0_cM?t=154][this video.]]

***** Allow literate programming with org-babel where org-babel block are treated as organized as "outline nodes oragnization" styles used in leo IDE.
requirement:
    literate programming using org-babel to tangle codes in non linear ways. This idea can be expanded to utilize leo ideo ideas of "outline nodes organization" (finer than file-based organization). To do this each org-babel block must be able to references "inside" other blocks (not only as input to other block) by tagging nodes of the block. t

Demo of this feature is demonstrated by using org-babel with org block and org-roam  literater devops + nodes-outlines organization (from leo IDE).

connect emacs to tmux.
**** add functionality to completion at point
I am talking about completion at point.

for example,
I imagine a completion that filter candidate like spc-s-b or alike.

imagine you wanna search for =+default/search-buffer= and you write +def/search and completion will show
1. list with def as prefix
   which show all that match the following regex (+def).*
2. list with (def).*\/(search).
