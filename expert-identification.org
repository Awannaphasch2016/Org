  - fix dataframe numpy and column stuff in get_tweets.
- does other social media api provide stream? (inspect their behavior)
- use free version first. (then scale from there.)
- cloud infrastructure design
  - how to store data that will later be used for machine learning.
    - do i need data lake?
    - do i need data warehouse?
    - dynamoDB
