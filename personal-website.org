*** project: create website for blog using org mode.
**** goal: publish website that capable of hosting org file
- ref
  - read the following tutorial: https://thackl.github.io/blogging-with-emacs-org-mode-and-jekyll
- note
  - my current blog is using jekyll but files are .md not .org.
  - I started to add org files into my blogs directory without testing whether or not it will work. On top of that, I didn't even follow naming convention which, if I remember correct, are necessary to make jekyll works. Hence, I don't expect it to work, so debug it.
*** TODO One I get my website running with jekyll, I need to merge my old blog post and articles. This includes changing file name and directory.
