        # Tools # What you will learn

- basic usecase of vowpal wabbit # Content
- what is vowpal wabbit?

  - Vowpal Wabbit provides fast, efficient, and flexible online machine
    learning techniques for reinforcement learning, supervised learning,
    and more. It is influenced by an ecosystem of community
    contributions, academic research, and proven algorithms. Microsoft
    Research is a major contributor to Vowpal Wabbit.

- what are vowpal wabbit's alternative?

  - vowpal wabbit

    - general purposed ml tools

      - however, main focus is on reinforcement learning

    - support

      - cmd
      - programming language library

  - sklearn

    - general purposed ml tools
    - support

      - programming language library

  - XGBoost

    - gradient boosted decision trees
    - support

      - programming language library

  - Weka

    - general purposed tools
    - support

      - cmd
      - application

- why vowpal wabbit?

  - faster than competitors by design.
  - online learning

- terminology

  - Data Syntax explaination

    - ref

      - https://vowpalwabbit.org/tutorials/getting_started.html

    - =[LABEL] [OPTIONS]: FEATURES:VALUE=

      - note

        - this syntax apply to every row

          - see ref link for example

      - full syntax

        - =[LABEL] [IMPORTANCE-WEIGHT] [INITIAL-PREDICTION] [TAG]: FEATURES:VALUE=

      - syntax

        - LABEL
        - IMPORTANT-WEIGHT

          - this implies that this esxample counts twice.
          - default = 1

        - INITIAL-PREDICTION

          - sometimes you have mutiple interaction learning systems and
            want to be able to predict an offset rather than an absolute
            value

            - [[validate]] I don't get it

        - TAG

          - name of row

- usecase

  - example

    - train a model =vw -d train.txt -f model.vw=
    - predict

      - =vw -d test.txt -i model.vw -p predictions.txt=
      - test with no prediction

        - =vw -i house.model -t house_dataset -p /dev/stdout --quiet=

    - adjusting validation set

      - =vw house_dataset -l 10 -c --passes 25 --holdout_off=

    - save your model into a file

      - =vw house_dataset -l 10 -c --passes 25 --holdout_off -f house.model=

    - debugging using --audit

      - note

        - helpful for debuggin a machine learning application

      - =vw house_dataset --audit --quiet=
