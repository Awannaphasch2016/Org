I am an internal student from Thailand currently doing PhD students on self-supervised dynamic graph neural network at Florida Atlantic University.

My hobbie is to curate my knowledge base by reading new interesting topics, refine content in my knowledge base (make highlight, write blog, write evergreen notes) and implement interesting application. (e.g https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x#build-your-own-git)

Outside of computer stuff, I love studying and experimenting with social dynamic skills such as talking to new group and understand group dynamics, etc. It sounds strange, but, in real like, it looks like friendly conversation.

** Tell us about your professional life:  What was your favorite job? Does your current work life have a nexus to Crypto / Web3?

I have 3 life long projects:
1. pen.el (personal assistance for workflow. It is, as of now, we called it emacs 2.0 which is emacs + resembrance agent AI. It uses prompt programming and our own semosis protocol to protect data trained on the language model.)

link to pen.el project (https://github.com/semiosis/pen.el)

2. Garun (a curated shared knowledged base with goal to collaborate on a knowledge work such as research using zettlekastin methods.)

3. expert identification. (algorithm to discover "expert" and weight their opinion such that user can ask question similar to searching google for answer.)

The goal of all of these projects are beyond my personal benefit. I genuinely want others to benefit from these projects. I don't think I have enough time in a day to move each project forward, so the only hope is to establish passionate community and work together to make them happen.

Until recently, after observing blockchain ecosystem from outside, I started to understand DAO concepts. I am convinced that to move any of these projects forward. I need to first find a community that have shared interest. My first stop is FWB.

Of course, there are more fundamental benefit of DAO like owning what you have contributed and socialize with blockchain enthusiastic people that attracts me.

No one around me is interested in web3, blockchain, and AI. So, my only hope is to connect with alike people online. By learning from successful project like FWB, I hope to build DAO community for
1. my own university, FAU
2. Boca Raton City.
3. Thailands
** What can you bring to FWB? This could be skill, and expertise, a unique perspective, etc
My main expertise is in graph-based machine learning engineer and artificial intelligence. I use Pytorch framework for deep learning.

I code in Python, JavaScript, Lisp, Scala, and Solidity.
I am open to learn other languages if it is required for a tasks.

I know DevOps tools like Terraform, Docker.

I occasionally use AWS as my main cloud services.

I am using Window and WSL2 (Ubuntu) as my main operating system.

Because I use Emacs, I learn about system configuration.

I write alot because I constantly refine my thought in my knowledgebase. This doesn't mean my writing is good, but I am striving to be a better writer. Still, it is good enough to convey my message to reader, so if there are writing tasks, I love to help out.

I can write in latex, org, and markdown.

I am not sure what "a unique perspective" could mean in the case of FWB. I am no blockchain expert. I want to be one. I see lots of things that decentralize mechanism like blockchain can fix. I am sure with my skill set and unique view of the world I can be a high value member of the community.

ask my mom about how visa and passport is issued?  when do I get to renew by visa? I know that with expired visa, I am still legal because of I-94 and I-20. I know that I-94 is about department-arrival information, but what exactly is I-20 used for? how is I-20 related to visa and password?
