**** rewrite report in weekly progress report from 2/21/2022 - 2/24/2022. ( I wrote description of the graph incorrectly.  )
** Tasks
*** NEXT run a models as discussed on <2022-02-24 Thu> meeting.
*** TODO question to answer to help with my own implementation :CANCELLED:
**** figure out how tgn does semi-supervised learning for node classification.
***** how does DDGCL uses GAN loss?
***** what is DDGCL architecture like?
***** is DDGCL generative or contrastive?
***** is DDGCL reconstruct next window or current window?
***** to understand how DDGCL train, I have to read the following paper,
1.MoCo
2.E2E

*** TODO finalize conclusion of ensemble modele's performance on 10k instances.
SCHEDULED: <2022-02-24 Thu>
**** How many models given window size of 200 do I need to beat the benchmark? (I know that 48 models beat benchmark, I also know that ensemble with ws of 1000 and 9 models can't beat benchmark.)
**** I need to increase number of models from 5 to 10. Does 10 models performance better? by how much?

**** get performance ensemble with original tgn models when train on 100k data and 200 1000 window size respectively.
